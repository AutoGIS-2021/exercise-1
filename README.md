# Exercise 1: Working with Geometric Objects

This week we will practice how to create geometric objects using Shapely in Python. In this exercise, you will also need to apply your skills from the [Geo-Python course](https://geo-python.github.io). In the first set of problems (1-2) you will define your own functions for handling geometric objects. In the second set of problems (3-4), you will read in data from a file using Pandas and create geometries based on coordinate information in the input data. 


- **Exercise 1 is due by Thursday 11th of November at 5 pm**.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L1/exercise-1.html#hints) if you're having trouble.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points**.

## Note

#### Solution code cells
You can always start working by removing these two lines of comments/code: 

```
# YOUR CODE HERE
raise NotImplementedError()
```
We are checking your solutions semi-automatically using [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) which is a package for creating and grading assingments in Jupyter Notebooks. Please use the suggested variable names when writing your code so that our hidden tests work smoothly :)

#### Non-editable code cells
Some of the code-cells are "non-editable" which means that you are supposed to run them, but you are not able to edit them. These Non-editable code cells should help you to test your code while you proceed.
